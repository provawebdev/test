Rules:

1. First take a folder or directory with any name
2. then open git bash cmd within that direcotory
3. take git folder with <git init>command
    do not touch or delete git folder becarefull
4. then create any file you want then check git status
    first it will be seen as an untracked file, we need to make
    it tracked or staged file with <git add file_name> if there is 
more than one file then short cut command <git add . >
5. now it is staged , so it can be commited now which is the last step 
for git <git commit -m "Any Messaged which is readable">
how if we check <git status> then it will show working directory clean
this is our last job . remember all of this is local repositiory

now i will do same things again and again

For Remote repository first if we want to keep our file
then we have to sign up 
I have already signed up
1. first we have to add remote repository
